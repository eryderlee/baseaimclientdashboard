## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Google Sheets as admin backend — Team already uses Sheets, no need for custom admin UI for 1-5 clients
- Standard milestones for all clients — Same service process for every client, simplifies both admin and client experience
- Individual client logins — Each client gets their own credentials to see their own data
- Checklist-style progress (not timeline) — Simple, clear, easy to understand at a glance

**From Phase 01-01:**
- 2-column layout (50/50 split) — Equal space distribution between stat cards and analytics provides better balance
- Vertical stat card stacking — Taller left column matches analytics chart height better than 2x2 grid
- Expandable components pattern — Client-side toggle with conditional column spanning established for future UI features

**From Phase 02-01:**
- Notes stored as Json array instead of separate table — Simpler for MVP changelog, can migrate to table later if needed
- Standard 6-milestone template matches BaseAim service process — Consistent experience across all clients
- Seed function returns created milestones — Enables verification and further operations during client onboarding

**From Phase 02-02:**
- Color-blind-safe status indicators use icons + text labels — Accessibility requirement, not color alone
- Active milestone highlighted with ring-2 ring-primary — Clear visual hierarchy for current work
- Week-level date precision with Intl.DateTimeFormat — Matches business process, locale-safe formatting
- Overall progress as completion percentage — Simple metric, matches checklist mental model

**From Phase 02-03:**
- Client-side rendering for progress page — Defers auth/database complexity to Phase 3, allows UI testing now
- Mock milestone data matches BaseAim service process — 5 realistic milestones for demonstration
- Dashboard uses shared calculateOverallProgress utility — Ensures consistency across pages
