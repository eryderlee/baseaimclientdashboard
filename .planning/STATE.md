## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Google Sheets as admin backend — Team already uses Sheets, no need for custom admin UI for 1-5 clients
- Standard milestones for all clients — Same service process for every client, simplifies both admin and client experience
- Individual client logins — Each client gets their own credentials to see their own data
- Checklist-style progress (not timeline) — Simple, clear, easy to understand at a glance
