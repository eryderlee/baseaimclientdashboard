## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Google Sheets as admin backend — Team already uses Sheets, no need for custom admin UI for 1-5 clients
- Standard milestones for all clients — Same service process for every client, simplifies both admin and client experience
- Individual client logins — Each client gets their own credentials to see their own data
- Checklist-style progress (not timeline) — Simple, clear, easy to understand at a glance

**From Phase 01-01:**
- 2-column layout (50/50 split) — Equal space distribution between stat cards and analytics provides better balance
- Vertical stat card stacking — Taller left column matches analytics chart height better than 2x2 grid
- Expandable components pattern — Client-side toggle with conditional column spanning established for future UI features
